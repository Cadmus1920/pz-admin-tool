# v2.1.0 Final - Gameplay Tab Cleanup

## ✨ Additional Changes

### Cleaned Up "Gameplay" Tab

**BEFORE (messy):**
- Day/Time settings ✓
- Water/Elec shutoff ✓
- XP Multiplier ❌ (should be in Skills tab!)
- FoodLoot, WeaponLoot, OtherLoot ❌ (should be in Loot tab!)
- FarmingSpeed ❌ (removed - doesn't exist in B42)
- LootAbundance ❌ (should be in Loot tab!)
- NatureAbundance ❌ (removed - doesn't exist in B42)

**AFTER (clean):**
- Day/Time settings ✓
- Water/Elec shutoff ✓
- Note directing users to proper tabs ✓

### Enhanced "⭐ Skills & XP" Tab

**Added at TOP:**
- **GlobalToggle** (bool) - Enable/disable global multiplier
- **Global** (slider 0.01-1000) - Global XP multiplier value
- Clear warning: "When enabled, overrides ALL individual skills below"
- Note: Individual skills only apply when Global is OFF

**Organization:**
1. 🌐 Global XP Multiplier (overrides all)
2. Individual Skill Multipliers (only when global is off):
   - Physical & Movement (6)
   - Weapon Skills (9)
   - Crafting & Building (12)
   - Survival & Gathering (7)

### Enhanced "Loot Details" Tab

**Added at END:**
- 🔙 Build 41 Loot Settings (Legacy) section
- LootAbundance (B41)
- FoodLoot (B41)
- WeaponLoot (B41)
- OtherLoot (B41)
- Note explaining these are old Build 41 categories

## 🎯 What This Fixes

**Confusion Eliminated:**
- XP settings all in one place (Skills tab)
- Loot settings all in one place (Loot tab)
- Gameplay tab is now clean and focused

**Global XP Feature Now Accessible:**
- Users can now enable "Use Global Multiplier"
- Set one value (e.g., 2.0) to double ALL skill XP gains
- Or turn it off and customize each skill individually

**Build 41 Compatibility:**
- Old loot settings (FoodLoot, WeaponLoot, etc.) kept for Build 41 users
- Clearly marked as "Legacy"
- Users know to use Build 42 settings for better control

## 📊 Tab Summary (Final v2.1.0)

**Gameplay Tab:**
- Day Length, Start Date/Time/Year
- Water & Electricity Shutoff (+ modifiers)
- Clean and focused!

**Skills & XP Tab:**
- Global multiplier (toggle + value)
- 34 individual skill multipliers
- Clear hierarchy and warnings

**Loot Details Tab:**
- Build 42 system (HoursForLootRespawn + rarity factors)
- Detailed categories (FoodLootNew, etc.)
- Build 41 legacy settings (LootAbundance, FoodLoot, etc.)

## ✅ Verification

Checked against actual files:
- `Global` and `GlobalToggle` exist in Build 42 MultiplierConfig ✓
- `FoodLoot`, `WeaponLoot`, `OtherLoot` exist in Build 41 ✓
- These settings do NOT exist in Build 42 (use "New" versions instead) ✓

## 🎮 User Experience

**Before:**
- "Where's the global XP setting?"
- "Why is loot stuff in Gameplay?"
- "These tabs are confusing"

**After:**
- ✅ Global XP clearly at top of Skills tab
- ✅ All loot in Loot tab
- ✅ Clean, logical organization
- ✅ Clear labels (B41 vs B42 features)

This completes the v2.1.0 reorganization! Much cleaner and more intuitive.
